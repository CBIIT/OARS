# Theradex Oncology Reporting Migrations

## Overview
This folder contains an ordered collection of database change scripts. Add any database scripts using the format `000X_Script-Description.sql`.

The intention is that these scripts will be run in order to update the database schema to the latest version. If possible it is helpful to write scripts in in a way that they can be run multiple times without causing errors. 

The files will be run by database administrators.
